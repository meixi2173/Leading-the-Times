## 📖 What Is This?

The Blackout Protocol is not a software tool. It is a **scored ritual**—a piece of executable philosophy.

It uses the scenario of a controlled power outage to create a shared experience that forces a confrontation with our dependencies on centralized systems. It is the first operational component of a larger framework called the **Philosophical Galaxy**.
